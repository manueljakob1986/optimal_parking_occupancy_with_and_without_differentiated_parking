# optimal_parking_occupancy_with_and_without_differentiated_parking
The framework is implemented with the aid of a simple numerical solver such as Matlab. That data includes the time stamps of all cars arriving to the area, and the times they leave the area after parking, as well as the parking occupancy in the area at the start of our simulation.
