# Optimal parking occupancy with and without differentiated parking
This repository presents our framework for the publication: Jakob, M., and M. Menendez. 2020. “Optimal Parking Occupancy with and without Differentiated Parking: A Macroscopic Analysis”. Submitted to Transport Policy.

It represents the code required to run simulations for our dynamic macroscopic traffic and parking model focusing on optimal parking occupancy policies with and without differentiated parking. The code is implemented with the aid of a simple numerical solver such as Matlab.
